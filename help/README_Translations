The translations for evolution-guide should be placed in 
evolution/doc/<LANG_CODE>

In this directory you'll find two scripts.
   - update_po.pl -- Usage: ./update_po.pl <LANG_CODE> 
        Takes the sgml files from the C directory and creates sgml.po files 
	in a directory called <LANG_CODE>.po 
	You should translate this files as you would any other .po file, but
	you have to make sure you place all tags and don't miss anyone.

   - update_translation.pl -- Usage: ./update_translation.pl <LANG_CODE>
        Takes the sgml files from the C directory, the sgml.po files from 
	the <LANG_CODE>.po directory and creates the translated sgml files 
	and places them on the <LANG_CODE> directory.
	If a paragraph it is not translated the originial paragraph in 
	english is used instead (fuzzy paragraph are considered as 
	translated for the moment). Doing it this way you can make sure 
	you didn't miss any sgml tag on the .po files by compiling the 
	evolution guide.

Of course, translations can be done as usual translating the .sgml files 
directly. But let me point out a few advantages of doing it this way.

* You can start translating the guide as soon as you want. Doesn't matter 
  if the original files changes. No more waiting for the docu to be called
  stable.

* When a paragraph changes, it is marked as fuzzy, so you don't have to be 
  playing with diff to find out if the original sgml file changed and where.

* You don't need to keep several copies of the sgml files (usually you have
  to keep a copy of the file you are translating and an up-to-date copy to 
  be able to do a diff, to find out the changes)


If you want to make any modification to my scripts, please let me know 
before you do so and send me an explanation of the changes you want to 
make (this is only for learning purposes, I allways like to know how to 
make a better script) Of course, the scripts are under GPL, so you can do 
with them allmost anything you want. 
If you want to use this scripts in any other project different from the 
evolution guide translation, please let me know (just to make me fell good 
because people is using something I wrote ;-) )
