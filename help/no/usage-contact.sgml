  <title>Working with Your Contacts</title>
      <para>
        This chapter will show you how to use the
        <application>Evolution</application> addressbook to organize
        any amount of contact information, share addresses over a
        network, and several ways to save time with everyday tasks. To
        learn about configuring the addressbook, see <xref
        linkend="config-prefs-contact">. You can import contacts from
        other contact management tools with the Import tool by
        selecting
        <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem></menuchoice>,
        or by mailing them to yourself as vCard attachments.
      </para>

    <para>
       The toolbar for the addressbook is quite simple.

      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
       Your contact information fills the rest of the display.  Move
       through the cards alphabetically with the buttons and the
       scrollbar to the right of the window. Of course, if you have
       more than a few people listed, you'll want some way of finding
       them more quickly, which is why there's a search feature.

       If you want to add or change cards, you'll use the contact
       editor.  To change a card that already exists, double click on
       it to open the contact editor window.  If you want to create a new
       card, clicking the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button in the
       toolbar will open the same window, with blank entry boxes for
       you to fill in.

    <para>
      The contact editor window has two tabs,
      <guilabel>General</guilabel>, for basic contact information, and
      <guilabel>Details</guilabel>, for a more specific description of
      the person.  In addition, it contains a <guimenu>File</guimenu>

    <title>Organizing your Addressbook</title>
    <para>
       Organizing your addressbook is a lot like organizing your
       mail.  You can have folders and searches the same way you can
       with mail, but the addressbook does not allow Virtual Folders.  It
       does, however, allow each card to fall under several
       categories, and allow you to create your own categories.  To
       learn about categories, read <xref
       linkend="usage-contact-organize-group-category">.
    </para>

<!-- UNIMPLEMENTED FEATURE
    <para>
      Another useful <application>Evolution</application> feature is
      its ability to recognize when people live or work together.  If
      several people in your addressbook share an address, and you
      change the address for one of them,
      <application>Evolution</application> will ask you if you wish to
      change the address for all of them, or just for one.

    <sect2 id="usage-contact-organize-group">
      <title>Groups of contacts</title>
      <para>
         <application>Evolution</application> offers two ways for you
         to organize your cards.  The first way is to use folders;
         this works the same way mail folders do.  For more
         flexibility, you can also mark contacts as elements of
         different categories.  To better integrate with email tools,
         you can also create lists of contacts that you can send mail
         to as a single person.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="usage-contact-organize-group-folder">
	<title>Grouping with Folders</title>
	<para>
	   The simplest way to group address cards is to use folders.
	   By default, cards start in the
	   <guilabel>Contacts</guilabel> folder.  If you've read <xref
	   linkend="usage-mainwindow"> then you already know that you
	   can create a new folder by selecting 
           <menuchoice>
           <guimenu>File</guimenu>
	   <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu>
	   <guimenuitem>Folder</guimenuitem>
           </menuchoice>
           and that you can put new folders anywhere you like. Just
	   like with mail, cards must be in a card folder, and no card
	   can be in two places at once.  If you want more
	   flexibility, try <xref
	   linkend="usage-contact-organize-group-category">.
	 </para>
	<para>
          To put a card into a folder, just drag it there from the
          folder view.  Remember that contact cards can only go in
          contact folders, just like mail can only go in mail folders,
          and calendars in calendar folders.
         </para>
      </sect3>
      
      <sect3 id="usage-contact-organize-group-category">
	<title>Grouping with Categories</title>
	<para>
           The other way to group cards is to mark them as belonging
           to different categories.  
           That means that you
           can mark a card as being in several categories or no
           category at all.  For example, I put my friend Matthew's
           card in the "Business" category, because he works with me,
           the "Friends" category, because he's also my friend, and
           the "Frequent" category, because I call him all the time
           and can never remember his phone number.  
        </para>
	<para>
           To mark a card as belonging to a category, click the
           <guibutton>Categories</guibutton> button at the lower
           right.  From the dialog box that appears, you can check as
           many or as few categories as you like.
        </para>

       <!-- Feature Not Implemented
	<para>

           If the master list of categories doesn't suit you, you can
           add your own.  Just enter the new category's name in the
           text box, then click <guibutton>Categories</guibutton> and
           choose <guilabel>Add to Master List</guilabel> in the

       If you keep your cards on a network using an <glossterm
       linkend="ldap">LDAP</glossterm> server, you can share access to
       them, browse other peoples addressbooks, or maintain a shared set of
       contact information for your company or your department.  This
       is the sort of feature you'll want to use if your company has a
       list of vendors and clients that needs constant updating.  If
       you share calendars as well as addressbooks, people can avoid
       duplicating work and keep up to date on developments within
       their workgroup or across the entire company.
    </para>

	  <para>
	    Ray wants to schedule a meeting with Company X, so he
	    checks the network for the Company X address card so he
	    knows whom to call there.  Since his company also shares
	    calendars, he then learns that his co-worker Deanna has
	    already scheduled a meeting with Company X next Thursday.
	    He can either go to the meeting himself or ask Deanna to

       overload the network with a list of babysitters or tell

       you keep cards on your own computer, you can decide which items
       you want to make accessible to others.

              load the contents of LDAP folders immediately upon

              from the network. You can change this behavior in the

      <para>
	As noted before, when you get information about a person in
	the mail or in a calendar entry, you can add it to an address
	card.  To do so, right click on any email address or email
	message, and select <guimenuitem>Add Address
	Card</guimenuitem> from the menu that appears.  Of course,
	<application> Evolution</application> can also add cards from a
	hand-held device during HotSync operation.  For more
	information about that, see <xref linkend="usage-sync">.

         You can also use the addressbook to print postal addresses
	 on mailing labels.  Future versions of
	 <application>Evolution</application> will allow you to you
	 export a group of cards to a spreadsheet, database, or word
	 processor so you can print address labels or prepare large
	 mailings.
      </para>

    Need a map or directions? Click <guibutton>MapIt</guibutton> from
  within the addressbook, and <application>Evolution</application>
  will map the address for you online.
