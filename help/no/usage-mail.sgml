      Start the mail client by clicking on the
      <guibutton>Inbox</guibutton> icon in the shortcut bar, or by
      selecting a mail folder in the folder bar.  To read a message,
      select it in the message list; if you'd like to see it in its

	the direction of the sort, and if you click again, you'll
	sort them in reverse order. For example, click once on
	<guilabel>Date</guilabel> to sort messages by date from
	oldest to newest.  Click again, and
	<application>Evolution</application> sorts the list from
	newest to oldest. You can also right-click on the message

         When someone sends you HTML mail that includes an image in

	   recipients.
         </para>
         <para>
            The simplest way to direct a message is to put the email

            field, which denotes primary recipients.  To send mail to
            more than one or two people, you can use the

            Hearkening back to the dark ages when people used
            typewriters and there were no copy machines, "Cc" stands

            <guilabel>Bcc:</guilabel> is a little more complex.  You

            <guilabel>Bcc:</guilabel> list are hidden from the other
            recipients of the message. Use it to send mail to large
            groups of people, especially if they don't know each other
            or if privacy is a concern.  If your <guilabel>Bcc:</guilabel> field is absent, click

            <title>What is a Mailing List?</title>
            <para>
              Mailing Lists are one of the most popular tools for
              group collaboration on the Internet. Here's how they work: 
              <simplelist>
                <member>
                  Someone sends a message to a single address, like
                  <email>evolution@ximian.com</email>.
                </member>
                <member>
                  That address belongs to a program that distributes
                  the message to a list of recipients.
                </member>
             </simplelist>
               The mail management program lets individuals subscribe
               to or unsubscribe from the list at will, without
               requiring the message writers to remember the addresses
               of every recipient.
            </para>
            <para>
              Mailing list servers can also let network administrators
              control mail flow, list membership, and even moderate
              the content of mailing lists.

          The post office forwards your mail for you when you change

          The email <guilabel>Forward</guilabel> button
          works in much the same way.  It's particularly useful if you
          have received a message and you think someone else would
          like to see it.  You can forward a message as an attachment
          to a new message (this is the default) or
          you can send it <glossterm linkend="inline">inline</glossterm> as a quoted
          portion of the message you are sending.  Attachment
          forwarding is best if you want to send the full, unaltered
          message on to someone else.  Inline forwarding is best if
          you want to send portions of a message, or if you have a
          large number of comments on different sections of the
          message you are forwarding.  Remember to note from whom the

      Since IMAP folders exist on the server, and opening them or

      manager.  If you prefer to have every mail folder displayed, you
      can select that option as well. However, if you'd like to choose

	  <title>Public Key?  Private Key?  What is the difference?</title>
	  <para>
	    GPG uses two keys: public and private.  You can give your
	    public key to anyone you want to recieve
	    encrypted messages, or put it on a public key server so
	    that people can look it up before contacting you.
	    <emphasis>Never give your private key to anyone,
	    ever</emphasis>.  Your private key lets you decrypt any
	    message encrypted with your public key.
	  </para>
 	</note>

      <para>
        Using encryption takes a bit of forethought.  When you send a
        message that is encrypted, you must encrypt it using your
        intended recipient's public key.  To <emphasis>get</emphasis>
        an encrypted message, you must make sure that the sender has
        your public key in advance.
      </para>

      <para>
	You can use encryption in two different ways:
        <simplelist>
          <member>
             Encrypt the entire message, so that nobody but the recipient can read it.
          </member>
          <member>
            Attach an encrypted signature to a plain text message, so
            that the recipient can read the message without decrypting it, and 
            only needs decryption to verify the sender's identity.

             Now, GPG will generate your keys.  This may take awhile,

             happening. In fact, using your computer for something
             else actually helps to generate better keys, because it

      <para>
         GPG will create one list, or keyring, for your public keys
         and one for your private keys. All the public keys you know
         are stored in the file
