  <title>Managing your Schedule</title>

     <para>
      This chapter will show you how to use the Ximian Evolution
      Calendar to manage your schedule alone or in conjunction with
      peers.
     </para>

    <sect1 id ="usage-calendar-view"> 
    <title>Ways of Looking at your Calendar</title>
    <para>
       The toolbar offers you four different views of your calendar:
       <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Day
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>

	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Month
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      Press the calendar-shaped buttons on the right side of the toolbar to
      switch between views. 

      You can also select a range of
      days&mdash; three days, ten days, or a fortnight if you want
      &mdash; in the small calendar at the upper right.  To do this, simply click and drag on the days that you wish to view in your calendar.

    </para>
    <para>
       The <guibutton>Prev</guibutton> and <guibutton>Next</guibutton>
       buttons will move you forward and back in your calendar pages.
       If you're looking at only one day, you'll see tomorrow's page,
       or yesterday's.  If you're looking at your calendar by week or
       month, you'll move around by just that much.
       To come back to today's listing, click the
        <guibutton>Today</guibutton> button in the toolbar.
    </para>
    <para>
       To visit a specific date's calendar entries, click
       <guibutton>Go To</guibutton> and select the date in the dialog
       box that appears.
    </para>

  <sect1 id="usage-calendar-apts">
    <title>Scheduling With the Evolution Calendar</title>
    <para>
      Of course, you'll want to use the calendar to do more than find
      out what day it is. This section will tell you how to schedule
      appointments, set alarms, and determine appointment recurrence.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="usage-calendar-apts-basic">
      <title>Creating appointments</title>
      <para>
	To create a new appointment, select
        <menuchoice>
	  <guimenu>File</guimenu>
	  <guisubmenu>New</guisubmenu> 
	  <guimenuitem>Appointment</guimenuitem>
	</menuchoice>
	or click the <guibutton>New Appointment</guibutton> button on the left end
	of the toolbar. The <interface>New Appointment</interface>
	dialog will pop up with the menu bar, tool bar, and
	window full of choices for you.
      </para>
      <tip id="new-appointment-shortcut">
        <title>Shortcut</title>
        <para>
           If you don't need to enter more information than the date
           and time of the appointment, you just click in any blank
           space in the calendar and start typing. You can enter other
           information later with the appointment editor.
        </para>
      </tip>

      <para>
        Your appointment must have a starting and ending date &mdash; by
        default, today &mdash; but you can choose whether to give it
        starting and ending times or to mark it as an <guilabel>All
        day event</guilabel>. An <guilabel>All day event</guilabel>
        appears at the top of a day's appointment list, in the grey header under the date, rather than inside
        it.  That makes it easy to have appointments that overlap and fit
        inside each other.  For example, a conference might be an all
        day appointment, and the meetings at the conference would be timed
        appointments.  Of course, appointments with specific starting and ending
        times can also overlap.  When they do they're displayed as
        multiple columns in the day view of the calendar.
      </para>
      <para>
	<application>Evolution</application> supports the use of timezones.  If you share calendar files with friends or co-workers, it is quite possible you will need to configure your timezone.  To configure your timezone:

        The <guilabel>Recurrence</guilabel> tab lets you describe
        repetition in appointments ranging from once every day up to once
        every 100 years.  You can then choose a time and date when the
        appointment will stop recurring, and, under
