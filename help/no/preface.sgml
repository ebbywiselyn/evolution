        This book is divided into two parts, with several
        appendices. The first part is a <link linkend="usage">guided
        tour</link>, which will explain how to use
        <application>Evolution</application>.  If you are new to
        <application>Evolution</application> or to groupware in

        more advanced users, but anyone who wants to change the way
