1) Location: 

The OOOA Configuration dialog should be accessible from the "Tools" menu.

2) Defaults: 

When the user opens the OOOA Configuration dialog, the value of the "Status:" parameter should be "I am currently in the office".

3) Use: 

The user may toggle her in/out of the office status using the "Status:" radiobuttons. 

The user may specify an out of the office message in the text box provided. This message will be sent once to each sender who sends an email to the user while the user's status is "out of the office". 

FIXME: What event triggers the "Do you want to change status?" dialog?
